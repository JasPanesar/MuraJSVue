Mura & Vue.js: A Love Story

These are the code example modules for the "Mura & Vue.js: A Love Story" Webinar & talk.

Note that *Mura 7.1 is required* for these examples to work.

To test these examples:

1) enable "Mura ORM Scaffolding" in the Site Settings > Edit Site > Modueles section of the Mura administrator
2) place both the webinar_murajs and webinar_vuejs folders below the root /modules directory
3) reload your Mura instance using ?appreload&applydbupdates to initialize the modules and set up the required "officelocation" Mura ORM object
4) use "Inline Editing" on a blank page in your Mura site and drop one (or both) of these modules into the main body of the page

Note that you can manage (add/modify/delete) the data used by this example by going to the Content > Custom tab in your Mura adminstrator and clicking on the "Office Location" custom object.
